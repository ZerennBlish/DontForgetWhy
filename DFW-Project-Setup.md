# DFW Project Setup & Version History
**Part of the DFW Technical Reference** — 6 docs: Architecture, Data-Models, Features, Bug-History, Decisions, Project-Setup
**Last updated:** April 2, 2026

---

## 1. Project Overview

**App:** Don't Forget Why (DFW)
**Publisher:** Bald Guy & Company Games — "Apps that talk back"
**Developer:** Zerenn (solo developer, age 40, Colorado)
**Package:** com.zerennblish.DontForgetWhy
**Stack:** React Native 0.83.4 + Expo SDK 55 + TypeScript (strict mode)
**Platform:** Android (primary), iOS (secondary/future)
**Monetization:** Free, no ads, no tracking. Potential future Pro features ($1.99 one-time) for online content.
**GitHub:** https://github.com/ZerennBlish/DontForgetWhy
**Contact:** baldguyandcompanygames@gmail.com

**What it is:** An alarm, reminder, timer, and notepad app with built-in mini-games and a personality-driven identity. The hook: every alarm requires a mandatory note explaining WHY it was set. When the alarm fires, the note displays prominently. "Remember why you woke up."

**Store tagline:** "Set alarms. Forget why. Get roasted."
**Brand closer:** "No accounts. No tracking. No ads. Just you and your questionable memory."

**Built from scratch starting February 8, 2026.** First working prototype ran on Zerenn's phone within hours of the first session. The app went from zero to closed testing on Google Play in 10 days.

## 2. Hardware & Setup

### Desktop (Primary)
- Windows, AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, RTX 4070, 32GB RAM
- Windows user: `baldy`, WSL user: `zerenn`
- Project: `C:\DontForgetWhy` (WSL: `/mnt/c/DontForgetWhy`)
- Context files: `C:\DFW-Context\`
- Claude Code runs through WSL/Ubuntu
- ADB: `C:\platform-tools\platform-tools\adb.exe`

### Laptop (Backup — Fully Operational)
- Windows, 8GB RAM. Same path structure.
- All three branches available. Claude Code operational.

### Phone
- Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, production Play Store build only
- Dev builds cannot install over production (signature mismatch) — test on emulators
- Phone gets updates through Play Store

### Accounts
- **GitHub:** ZerennBlish
- **Expo:** zerennblish (Starter plan — $19/mo, ~$1/build, credits reset 12th)
- **Google Play Console:** Bald Guy & Company Games
- **PrimeTestLab:** Enterprise plan (93 tester emails)

### Terminal Rules
- **PowerShell:** dev server, npm install, EAS builds, ADB, git (daily workflow)
- **WSL:** Claude Code only
- Do NOT run git in PowerShell while Claude Code works in WSL on same repo
- Do NOT run dev server from WSL (gives internal IP phone can't reach)

### Emulator Testing Matrix
- 6 AVDs configured on both desktop and laptop machines
- Devices: Pixel 7 (baseline), Galaxy S25 FE (custom profile, 1080x2340 19.5:9), Pixel 5 (smaller 6.0"), Moto G Power (custom profile, 720x1600 budget), Galaxy S23 Ultra (custom profile, 1440x3088 QHD+), Pixel Tablet (2560x1600)
- All running API 35 (Android 15 VanillaIceCream) x86_64 system images
- EAS build profile "development-emulator" added to eas.json with env `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_reactNativeArchitectures=x86_64`
- Emulator dev build APK stored at `C:\DontForgetWhy\DFW-emulator.apk`
- ARM dev build for physical devices, x86_64 build for emulators — separate APKs
- All emulators connect to same dev server simultaneously for side-by-side testing
- Android Studio Panda 2 (2025.3.2) on both machines
- Windows Hypervisor Platform enabled on both machines for hardware acceleration
- adb path: `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\platform-tools` (may need full path in PowerShell: `& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe"`)

## 3. Project Structure

Codebase reorganized during Phase 1 housekeeping. All source files live under `src/` in categorized subfolders. Home is the `initialRouteName` (changed from AlarmList in v1.9.0).
